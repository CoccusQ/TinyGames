# TinyGames
## First and Foremost
This repositary is a collection of the games I programmed in college.
Just for practicing my c++ skills and for fun.
## Current Games List
### Sisyphus
Probably, this game is boring. All the things you need to do is to push the rock to the top of the mountain, just like what Sisyphus did.
Howerver, there will be some random challenges waiting for you. Want to have a try?
### Survivors
